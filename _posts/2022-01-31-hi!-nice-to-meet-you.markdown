title: Hi! Nice to meet you.

I'm glad you've stumbled upon my fifth, no sixth, maybe tenth (who keeps countâ€¦) attempt at creating a personal website/blog.
I intent to upload as much stuff as possible here. So expect notes, discoveries and maybe even some occasional wisdom.

Sidenote: If you're specifically searching for wisdom though, I'd highly recommend ["The Wisdom Project" by Merlin Mann](https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom).

I'm a Software Engineer by trade, so this site will mainly focus on technology and the perils of writing software, that is intended to be considered helpful by other people, for a living. Other topics have not been decided yet as I'm pretty happy with the rest of my life, so there isn't much to write about.

### What about the name **technocidal**?

The first mention of the word "technocidal" I was able to find is in [this delightful Wired article](https://www.wired.com/1998/08/die/) from 1998 about competitve robot wrestling. A more modern definition can be found on [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=technocidal) 
which defines *technocidal* as the urge to kill a piece of "malfuntioning" electrical equipment.

I'm totally onboard with robot wrestling and also very familiar with the emotion described by the latter definition, so the word really stuck with me.
