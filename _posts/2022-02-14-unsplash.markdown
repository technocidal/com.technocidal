A couple of weeks ago I've submitted pictures I took to Unsplash for the first time.
This was a fairly weird experience for me. Photography appears to be such a widespread hobby amongst programmers, that it feels almost too clich√© to admit to it publicly.
Getting into cameras seems to be just what you do, when you work in technology.

It was also a bit scary. While posting to social media always felt really low stakes, publishing you work on a dedicated photography platform like Unsplash felt intimidating.

When choosing some of my first pictures, I realised, just how hard it is, to not be too critical with your own work. The first album I'm going through now contains all the pictures I took during a vacation to Israel. This was one of the most interesting experiences of my whole life, so it seemed like a good choice to start there. But is there anything interesting in there? I mean, most of the "classic street photography style" pictures mainly make sense to me and a good chunk of the album are basically pictures I took for the sake of having a picture of what I saw during the trip. They are pretty recognisable by their poor composition, contrast and overall apparent lack of care. I just wanted a picture to remember that when I visited Masada, an ancient Roman fortress, there was a tiny model of the whole structure that had dollhouse-like mosaic floors.

	.gallery-grid {
		display: grid;
		grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(160px, 1fr));
		grid-gap: 1.5rem;
		justify-items: center;
		align-items: end;
		margin: 0;
		padding: 0;
	}
	
	.spotlight {
		height: 24rem;
		text-align: center;
	}
	
	.spotlight-img {

	.spotlight-img:hover {
		opacity: .7;
	}
	
	.gallery-img {
		max-width: 100%;
		height: auto;
		object-fit: cover;
		transition: opacity 0.25s ease-in-out;
	}
	
	.gallery-img:hover {
		opacity: .7;
	}
</style>

<div class="gallery-grid">

But going through the album also made me realise that there was one motive that comes up quite a lot - Flowers. Everyone likes pictures of flowers. You can look through the profile pictures/home screens of the older part of your family and I bet that a lot of them will have picked flowers to put there.

So that's where I started. I edited and upload a picture of an almond tree flower. It's a start and let's see where this goes.
